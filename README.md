# REGEX-TO-NFA
A web application to demonstrate conversion from regular expression to NFA and NFA to DFA.

## INTRODUCTION
I have created a website unsing vanilla JavaScript with the functionality to convert an input Regular Expression to a Non-deterministic Finite Automata, then theat Non-deterministic finite Automata to Deterministic Finite Automata. The website doesn't use any extra libraries and thus is a very light weight and basic website. The main functionality of the website was fulfilled and I have not focussed on the UI as much.

## Conversion from Regex to NFA
The process of conversion of regex to NFA is not defined anywhere properly. So I will try to defined what I have done. Firstly, I will assume that the people have wrote the regex according to the instructions I have provided on the website. I have attached a screenshot below for reference.
